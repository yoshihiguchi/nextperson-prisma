## People API Documentation

### Overview

This API allows for managing a list of people, supporting operations to retrieve all people and to add a new person to the list. It is built using Next.js and Prisma.

### Prisma Schema

The Prisma schema for this project defines the structure of the data related to `Person`. You can find the schema in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file. 

The `Person` model typically looks like this:

```prisma
model Person {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  firstname String
  lastname  String
  phone     String
}
```

### Environment Setup

Before running the project, you need to set up your `.env` file in the project's root directory. This file should include the database connection string:

```
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
```

Replace `"your-database-connection-string"` with your actual database connection string.

### Running Migrations

After setting up your `.env` file, run Prisma migrations to set up your database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This command creates the necessary tables in your database according to the Prisma schema.
